# Tremor Smart Mouse
This is a repository for the Rehabilitation Engineering (EEEN40350) assignment to come up with an innovative solution to limit the impact that tremor has on patients with tremor.

Tremor has a huge impact on the lives of patients suffering from it. The best way to help tremor patients is by coming up with innovative technology that would limit the impact that tremor has on their lives. 
One could imagine how tough it would be to use a mouse as a patient suffering from tremor.

For one of the assigments I had in Rehabilitation Engineering (EEEN40350) module, I coded a software that would remove the noisy movement of the cursor and make it a straight line. This was coded in Matlab and basically fulters the x and y coordinates of the curser to achieve that. 
It is not a  suffisticated tool but I found it really impressive to work! For more details checkout the [code](https://github.com/adildahlan/tremor-smart-mouse/blob/main/code.m) and the [report](https://github.com/adildahlan/tremor-smart-mouse/blob/main/report.pdf) Let me know what you think!
